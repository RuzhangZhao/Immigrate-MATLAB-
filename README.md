# Immigrate-MATLAB-

This project is the MATLAB code version for IMMIGRATE algorithm(${\bf I}$terative $\bf{M}$ax-$\bf{MI}$n entropy mar$\bf{G}$in-maximization with inte$\bf{RA}$ction $\bf{TE}$rms algorithm, IMMIGRATE, henceforth).

IMMIGRATE is a hypothesis-margin based feature selection method with interaction terms. For more details, please refer to the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02658.pdf).
